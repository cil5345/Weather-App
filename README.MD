# My Weather App


## Intro
Weather is very unpredicatable. One minute it can be sunny and then next it can be pouring down rain. Luckily my weather app was created to predict the weather 5 days.

## My Weather App
My weather app is for the every day user who wants quick information about the weather. With the api intergration from open weather map, I was able to create a website that could display weather from any city in the world. My app displays the current date, city, temperature in â„‰, humidity, and windspeed. It also shows an icon that is congruent with the weather of that day. There is also a 5 day weather forecast that quickly shows the weather for those next days.

## Add ons for the future
I would probably make it look better by adding some carasouels and hovering the 5 day forecast

## Conclusion 
The weather app is great for those who want information about the current and future weather in any city. This app utilized api intergation from open weather map, jquery, and bootstrap.
